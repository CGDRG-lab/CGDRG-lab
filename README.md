# Cancer & Genetic Disorder Research Group (CGDRG)

The **Cancer & Genetic Disorder Research Group (CGDRG)** is an academic research group based in the **Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology**, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Led by **Mustak Ibn Ayub, DPhil**, our group focuses on understanding the molecular and genetic basis of cancer and inherited disorders through both **wet lab experiments** and **computational biology** approaches.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Focus

- Cancer genomics and mutation signatures
- Genetic disorders and population-specific variants
- Transcriptomic and epigenomic biomarkers
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in molecular biology
- Systems biology and multi-omics integration
